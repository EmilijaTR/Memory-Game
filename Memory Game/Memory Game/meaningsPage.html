    		<p><b>The Chariot</b> card means you're focused, determined, and ready to take action. Much like The Chariot, calling an Uber, Lyft, or whatever often indicates the start of a night out — and the end of one, TBH. It's like the ultimate call to action, I think!!!</p>

  		<div class="container">
    		<p><b>The Fool</b> represents new beginnings, hope for the future, and faith in the universe. Skipping town and ghosting your latest match gives off major ~Fool vibes~.</p>

    		<p><b>The Hermit</b> card means that you're entering a period of introspection and you'll be looking for answers within yourself...So why not start by bingeing Gilmore Girls for the fourth time?!?!?!?!

	<div class="card item">
  		<img src="theLovers.webp" alt="Avatar">
  		<div class="container">
    		<p><b>The Lovers</b> card indicates that you're gonna have to make some sort of impactful decision about a relationship, fling, or ~flirtation~ soon. Obviously with a lot of today's dating, we put fate into the hands of apps. I mean, swiping right counts as an impactful decision, right?</p>

  		<div class="container">
    		<p><b>The Moon</b> is a card of illusion and often suggests that something isn't as it appears to be. Sometimes, this can be a truth that you can't admit to yourself. Going camping with your dog is always a good way to clear your mind.</p>

	<div class="card item">
  		<img src="card5.webp" alt="Avatar">
  		<div class="container">
    		<p><b>The Sun</b> card reflects positive, enthusiastic feelings — the same feeling you get on Sunday morning when you can finally chill out, eat your avocado toast, and finally get back to bullet journaling.</p>

	<div class="card item">
  		<img src="card6.webp" alt="Avatar">
  		<div class="container">
    		<p><b>The Tower</b> is usually interpreted as signaling drastic change, crisis, destruction, and/or liberation. Naturally, playing Giant Jenga at a bar seems to evoke the same sort of feelings.</p>

	<div class="card item">
  		<img src="theWorld.webp" alt="Avatar">
  		<div class="container">
    		<p>And lastly, <b>The World</b> card represents the ending of one life cycle and the beginning of another. It stands for success, possibilities, and major change, and serves as a reminder to be ever-changing and optimistic in life.</p>
