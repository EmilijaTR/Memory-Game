			<br><br>
			The player can select the level of difficulty to play with. The cards will be shuffled and laid out face down on the screen in a grid pattern.
			<br><br>
			To play the game, the player clicks on two cards to flip them over. If they match, they will stay visible on the screen, and the player can continue to select pairs of cards until all the cards have been matched. If the cards do not match, they will flip back over, and the player can try again.
			<br><br>
			The goal of playing the game is to find all the matching pairs of cards.
			<br><br>
			Remember to concentrate and try to remember where each card is located to increase your chances of making a match. Have fun playing the Memory Game!
